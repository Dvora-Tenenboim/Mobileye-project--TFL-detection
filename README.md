# Traffic Lights Detection - A Mobileye Project
Detecting traffic lights and the distance to them, using image processing and machine learning, in 4 parts:

1. Detection of source lights in an image using convolution with customized high-pass filter.
2. Generating and training CNN using the products of the previous stage as input, to conclude all the traffic lights in the image.
3. Estimating the distance to each detected traffic light from the camera picturing the images of interest, involving geometric and linear algebra calculations (SFM).
4. Integrating all previous parts into a functional and intuitive SW product.
